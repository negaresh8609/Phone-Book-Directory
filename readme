The main purpose of this program is that when we are dealing with a large number of numbers, instead of saving them all on our phone, we can read and use them from an Excel file.
This program reads an Excel file containing 4 columns with names, first name, last name, school, and number. Then, by searching for a part of the combination of first name, last name, school with at least 2 characters, it shows a list of names that meet these conditions and their contact numbers. And it allows you to call the desired number by clicking on their name.
Since I am not familiar enough with programming, I tried to use artificial intelligence for this, but unfortunately the result so far is an incomplete program that has a lot of errors.
I am currently looking for help and solutions to solve the errors.
Please do not hesitate to help in any way you can
This program is very useful for people in my field of work
